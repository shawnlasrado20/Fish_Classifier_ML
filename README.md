## üìå Project Overview
This project uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify fish species from images.  
The workflow involved:
- **Curating and preprocessing** a fish species dataset
- Applying **data augmentation** to improve generalization
- Experimenting with multiple CNN architectures
- Selecting and fine-tuning the **best-performing model**
- Deploying as a **Streamlit web app** for instant predictions

## üí° What I Learned
- **Data preprocessing & augmentation** are crucial for building robust ML models.  
- **Model selection matters** ‚Äî not all popular architectures perform equally well on every dataset.  
  - MobileNet achieved the best results  
  - ResNet50 and EfficientNetB0 underperformed despite fine-tuning  
- **Transfer learning** can greatly improve results.  
- **Side-by-side model evaluation** makes it easier to choose the best for deployment.  
- **Streamlit** is a simple yet powerful way to make AI models accessible.

## üèÜ Final Model
- **Architecture:** MobileNet (fine-tuned)  
- **Test Accuracy:** ~99%  
- **Outperformed:** VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB0
